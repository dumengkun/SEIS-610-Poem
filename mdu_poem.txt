PSALM 1

1 Blessed is the man
  Who walks not in the counsel of the ungodly,
  Nor stands in the path of sinners,
  Nor sits in the seat of the scornful;
2 But his delight is in the law of the Lord,
  And in His law he meditates day and night.
3 He shall be like a tree
  Planted by the rivers of water,
  That brings forth its fruit in its season,
  Whose leaf also shall not wither;
  And whatever he does shall prosper.
4 The ungodly are not so,
  But are like the chaff which the wind drives away.
5 Therefore the ungodly shall not stand in the judgment,
  Nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous.
6 For the Lord knows the way of the righteous,
  But the way of the ungodly shall perish.


PSALMS 23
A Psalm of David.

1 The Lord is my shepherd;
  I shall not want.
2 He makes me to lie down in green pastures;
  He leads me beside the still waters.
3 He restores my soul;
  He leads me in the paths of righteousness
  For His nameâ€™s sake.
4 Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death,
  I will fear no evil;
  For You are with me;
  Your rod and Your staff, they comfort me.
5 You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies;
  You anoint my head with oil;
  My cup runs over.
6 Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me
  All the days of my life;
  And I will dwell in the house of the Lord
  Forever.
